# CPSC 449 Project-3
## Spencer DeMera & Ricardo Segarra

## Project Description:
This project uses a variety of tools and services to power two RESTful back-end services that facilitate user interaction and communication via digital blogging. Users can view three different timelines, follow other users, create new posts, users can be added, and repost other posts. Additionally, users can now like posts and conduct polls while being able to view the results/metadata of both.

## Contents:
* File README.md. README file for the project.
* FOLDER api. Folder that contains all api files.
    * FILE Procfile. Procfile for foreman service definitions.
    * FILE .env. Env file for avoiding missing input.
    * FILE haproxy.cfg. HAProxy configuration file.
    * FILES userAPI.py & postAPI.py. User and Post API files.
    * FILES likesAPI.py, pollsAPI.py, & srvcRegAPI.py. Files for likes, polls, and servce registry microservices
    * FILES data/users.csv, data/followers.csv & data/posts.csv. CSV schema files for each database.
    * FOLDER log. Log folder to contain api.log files.
    * FILES bin/init.sh, bin/foreman.sh & dataStores.sh. Initilization scripts for database schemas, foreman start and NoSQL data stores.
    * FILE bin/initPolls.py. Initilization scripts for polls service DynamoDB datastore.
    * FILES configs/userAPI.ini & postAPI.ini. Initilization files for SQLite DBs.
    * FILE configs/logging.ini. Initilization file for SQLite logging and configs.

## Issues & Incomplete Functionalities
* Issues
    * Number in place of `username` value on JSON output after new user is created
        * addUser will output JSON with the number of users instead of username in `username` when displayed after run
        * The actual new user object created by addUser will actually have the created username value in `username`
            * Not sure what is causing said issue, insufficent time to resolve issue
    * Foreman is non-operable on both our WSL & Tuffic installations regardless of restarts OR reinstalls
        * All components work separately and together when using `hug -f <filename>` commands
            * There is no guarentee that all will work with foreman together unfortunately
            * Insufficient information available & time to complete
* Incomplete functions
    * Repost code is fully implemented but the server throws HTTP 405 upon POST request
        * Insufficient time to resolve issue
